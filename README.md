## Overview

### Description 
The **pyomocontrib_simplemodel** package is software for modeling
and solving optimization problems.  This package is derived from
[Pyomo](http://www.pyomo.org), and it defines the class **SimpleModel** that illustrates
how Pyomo can be used in a simple, less object-oriented manner.
Specifically, this class mimics the modeling style supported by
[PuLP](https://github.com/coin-or/pulp):

| Feature | PuLP | SimpleModel |
|:---------|------:|-------------:|
|LP/MILP  | YES  | YES         |
| NLP/MINLP | NO | YES |
|Column-wise | YES | NO |
